# GitHub Actions

In December 2022, we decided to move to [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions). Why? It seems where tools and focus is using. Plus, the idea of keeping workflow in with code makes more sense.

Notes:

* We used the site https://pipelinestoactions.azurewebsites.net/ to convert from Azure Devops YML to GitHub Actions Workflow YML.

* When developing locally and pushing changes you might not want to trigger the workflow. Use these commit message tricks:  https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/skipping-workflow-runs.

# GitHub Actions

Notes:

* The site https://pipelinestoactions.azurewebsites.net/ can help you convert from Azure Devops YML to GitHub Actions Workflow YML.

* When developing locally and pushing changes you might not want to trigger the workflow. Use these commit message tricks:  https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/skipping-workflow-runs.

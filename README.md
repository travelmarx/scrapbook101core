# travelmarx scrapbook101core

Scrapbook101core is a simplified version of the Scrapbook project described in the blog post *[A Personal Information Management System: Introducing Scrapbook](http://blog.travelmarx.com/2017/12/a-personal-information-management-system-introducing-scrapbook.html)*. 

The technical documentation for Scrapbook101core can be see at https://travelmarx.github.io/scrapbook101core/index.html.

Scrapbook101core runs on .NET Core. We created another version for ASP.NET [here](https://travelmarx.github.io/scrapbook101/), but development on that has stopped.
